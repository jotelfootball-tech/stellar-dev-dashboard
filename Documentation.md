## Overview

**Stellar Dev Dashboard** is a free, open-source web application that gives Stellar developers a unified, real-time view of accounts, transactions, smart contracts, and network activity — all in one place.

It is purpose-built for developers working on the Stellar ecosystem who need quick access to on-chain data without switching between multiple tools. Whether you're debugging a Soroban contract, checking account balances, or monitoring network fee stats, this dashboard brings it all under one roof.

This project is actively maintained and participates in the [Stellar Wave Program](https://www.drips.network/wave/stellar) on Drips — a monthly open-source contribution sprint where contributors can earn rewards for merged pull requests.

## Features

### 🔑 Account & Balance Viewer
Inspect any Stellar public key in detail. View all asset balances (XLM and non-native), account flags, signing thresholds, signer list, and sequence number. Works on both Mainnet and Testnet.

### ⇄ Transaction & Operation History
Browse the full transaction and operation history for any account. Filter between transactions and individual operations, with details including fees, memos, timestamps, and direct links to Stellar Expert.

### ◻ Soroban Contract Explorer
Enter any Soroban smart contract address to inspect its on-chain ledger data, WASM hash, and persistent instance storage via the Soroban RPC. Built to support developers actively building and debugging contracts.

### ◎ Network Stats
Live network information including the latest ledger sequence, base fee, transaction count, operation count, fee percentile breakdowns (P10–P90), and a stream of recent ledgers.

### ⬡ Testnet Faucet
Fund any testnet account directly from the dashboard using Stellar's Friendbot. Activates new accounts and re-funds existing ones with 10,000 XLM. Only available on Testnet.

### 🔌 Wallet Connect
Connect any Stellar public key (G...) on either Mainnet or Testnet to load account data, history, and balances instantly.
